## 2️⃣ Search

You can find materials through the search bar on the main screen.

### 🔍 Natural Language Search
You can ask questions in **sentence form**, not just simple keywords.
* Ex: *"What is the method to prevent overfitting in deep learning?"*
* Ex: *"Find last week's meeting minutes"*

### 📂 Filtering
If there are too many search results, use filters.
* **File Format:** View only PDF, View only Code, etc.
* **Date:** Search files created within a specific period

## 3️⃣ Utilizing Results

The search result card displays the following information:

* **Summary:** AI summarizes what the document is about.
* **Preview:** Check key contents without opening the file.
* **Score:** Shows a score of how relevant it is to your question.

**Open Directly**
Clicking the result card immediately opens the file in the default viewer.
